# loocup
Find C function declarations by a pattern.

Essentially [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) for C. Inspired by [Coogle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VYhYLxY-i7OcvBbDsG4izam)

## Getting started
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lauchimoon/loocup.git
$ cd loocup/
$ zig build -p .
```
This generates a single directory `bin` inside the current working directory, in which `loocup` is at.
